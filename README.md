# Integrity-vs-opportunism-under-loss
A minimal, inspectable simulation exploring how integrity-aligned behavior incurs loss in optimized systems, while coherence under loss generates trust that reward-driven models fail to measure. Includes code and a white paper examining structural blind spots in optimization-based decision systems.
